	  <h1 class = "webTitle">Miami International Airport Holiday Coupons</h1>
	 While working for Sleon Productions, I was tasked with developing an application 
	 for the Miami International Airport which would allow shoppers to print out, as well 
	 as use their phones to display coupons throughout the airport during the holiday season. 
	 The site utitlizes Javascript browser cacheing capabilities, allowing users to click on as many 
	 coupons as they like, save them, and print them out. Alternatively they can just use their phones 
	 to show their saved coupons. Also, this application allows users to filter their coupon search by airport terminal and store type.

	  <h1 class = "webTitle">National Children's Center</h1>
	 While working for Sleon Productions, I developed a Wordpress website for the National Children's Center, 
	 a non profit organization based in Washington DC which provides servces for intellectually and developemetally 
	 disabled children and adults. An older version of the site already existed, but my task was to do a full redesign 
	 with a new theme. Most aspects of the site allow the user to easily edit information using custom widget areas which 
	 I added.

	 This is a full scale application I developed using PHP and MySQL which determines who you have the most in common with 
	 in the world! ( Or at least everyone who's already taken the survey) It's basically just a questionairre, your answers 
	 getting logged into a database and then cross referenced against everyone else in the database to determine who you have 
	 the most in common with...In the world!

	  <h1 class = "webTitle">David Rothkopf Tutoring</h1>
	This is a site I built for a tutoring business that I was considering starting until I got employed somewhere else. 
	I used Bootstrap for this one, utilizing the column system for lining up the images and having them collapse as the 
	viewport gets narrower. I also like the effect where text boxes appear when you click on the images, which allows 
	everything on this site to just be on one page.

	  <h1 class = "webTitle">My Favorite Quotes</h1>
	This site randomly generates some of my favorite quotations. I made this site when I was learning Jquery and I still think 
	it's kind of neat how each quote generates a new color to fade in. Also there is a button to Tweet the quote on screen.
