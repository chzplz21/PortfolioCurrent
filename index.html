	<p>
	Hey! My name is David Rothkopf and I am a web developer living in South Florida. I have professional experience working at Sleon Productions where I was the sole developer on projects including Wordpress websites for the Miami International Airport and the National Children's Center, an organization based in Washington DC. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I am proficient in HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery and am gaining working capability with PHP and MySQL. I'm knowledgeble within Wordpress as all projects I did with Sleon Productions were within the Wordpress platform. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I'm very easy to get along with and I have a BA in Philosophy from UCF. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In my free time I'm into playing/making music, going on bike rides, and have recently gotten into Poi (Spinning balls attached to ropes). I just like to hang out too, it's cool.
